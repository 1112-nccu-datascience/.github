# Hi there üëã
Welcome to the `NCCU Data Science 111-2` course, where you will learn about the concepts and techniques used in data analysis and modeling using the R programming language. This course covers a range of topics, from data exploration and visualization to machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. Whether you are new to data science or have some prior experience, this course is designed to help you advance your skills and knowledge.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Data Science Basic Concepts and Techniques
- Perform data exploration and visualization using R
- Build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning algorithms in R
- Communicate your findings and insights effectively to a non-technical audience
- Learn to use the github platform and create a project of your own on github

## About final project
The final project of this course calls for students from different departments to work together and implement a data science project. The project topic can be sourced from public data, public competitions (i.e., Kaggle) or your own dataset. Each group of students is expected to thoroughly organize the project into a complete and public github repository, and communicate effectively with their classmates.

## Over All
We are confident that you will find this course both challenging and rewarding, and that you will emerge with a solid foundation in data science using the R programming language. So, let's dive in and start learning!
